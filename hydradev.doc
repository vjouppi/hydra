Some comments about the Sana2-driver for Hydra ethernet cards.

  - The name of the device is 'hydra.device'. Unit 0 is the first
    Hydra ethernet card in the machine, unit 1 is second, unit 2 is third etc.

  - The device clears the CONFIGME-flag in the ConfigDev-structure of
    the ethernet card when it is opened the first time. It sets the
    flag back when it is flushed from memory. It refuses to open
    if the CONFIGME-flag is clear.

  - The device should now work with both 16k and 64k cards.

  - DMA is not used.

  - The device should work with Kickstart 1.2 or later (but most Sana2-
    compatible software requires 2.0 or later. Also most other sana2-
    devices probably use the utility.library functions for tag list handling,
    so they need 2.0+ too)

  - Promiscuous mode and exclusive access are supported.

  - The device can be opened with the ios2_BufferManagement-field set
    to NULL, if you don't need to use the actual packet send/receive
    functions (a dummy copy routine that does nothing is used in that case)

  - S2_CONFIGINTERFACE-command allows setting the address to any valid
    ethernet address (this is a little different from the Sana2-standard
    that says that ethernet cards should only be configured to the
    default (ROM) address).

  - S2_READORPHAN-command sets the packet type field of the IORequest
    to the type of the received packet. This is sometimes useful,
    but nonstandard.

  - Special stats include bad multicast hash filtering and packet collisition
    count (but the collision stats don't seem to work properly, this
    will be fixed)

  - CMD_WRITE allows multicast/broadcast packets. Commodore's a2065.device
    also does this.

  - Global stats 'Overruns' counts receive buffer ring overflows.

  - The device supports all standard SANA2 commands.
