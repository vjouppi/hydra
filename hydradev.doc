(muuten, devicen sourcesta l|ytyi unohtunut kommentti, siin{
lukee ett{ 'these commands are not yet implemented, ja per{ss{ tulee

Some comments about the Sana2-driver for Hydra ethernet cards.

  - The name of the device is 'hydra.device'. Unit 0 is the first
    Hydra ethernet card in the machine, unit 1 is second, unit 2 is third etc.

  - The device clears the CONFIGME-flag in the ConfigDev-structure of
    the ethernet card when it is opened the first time. It sets the
    flag back when it is flushed from memory. It refuses to open
    if the CONFIGME-flag is clear.

  - The device has only been tested with cards with 16k RAM. It has some
    ram size detecting code, but it doesn't currently properly
    support 64k RAM (this will be fixed, of course).

  - DMA is not used.

  - The device should work with Kickstart 1.2 or later (but most Sana2-
    compatible software requires 2.0 or later. Also most other sana2-
    devices probably use the utility.library functions for tag list handling,
    so they need 2.0+ too)

  - Promiscuous mode and exclusive access are supported.

  - The device can be opened with the ios2_BufferManagement-field set
    to NULL, if you don't need to use the actual packet send/receive
    functions (a dummy copy routine that does nothing is used in that case)

  - S2_CONFIGINTERFACE-command allows setting the address to any valid
    ethernet address (this is a little different from the Sana2-standard
    that says that ethernet cards should only be configured to the
    default (ROM) address).

  - S2_READORPHAN-command sets the packet type field of the IORequest
    to the type of the received packet. This is sometimes useful,
    but nonstandard.

  - Special stats include bad multicast hash filtering and packet collisition
    count (but the collision stats don't seem to work properly, this
    will be fixed)

  - CMD_WRITE allows multicast/broadcast packets. Commodore's a2065.device
    also does this.

  - Global stats 'Overruns' counts receive buffer ring overflows.

  - The device supports all standard SANA2 commands.
